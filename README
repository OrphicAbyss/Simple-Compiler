Following the "LET'S BUILD A COMPILER!" tutorial by Jack W. Crenshaw, Ph.D.

Currently Pascal based compiler which outputs 68000 assembler.

Deviation from tutorial:
Unary Minus - Handled in factor which allowed for simpler asm output.

Future goals:
* Actually finish it
* Convert to x86 asm
* Might convert compiler to new language (bootstrap it?)
